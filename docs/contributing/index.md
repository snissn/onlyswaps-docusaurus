# Contributing

We welcome PRs that improve docs, examples, and developer tooling.

## Style

- Use clear, active voice.
- Show complete, copy‑paste‑able snippets.
- Prefer **Links to source** over long code dumps.

## Testing

- For contracts: add Foundry/Hardhat tests.
- For solver: add unit tests and run E2E against two dev chains.
- For SDK: add Jest/Vitest tests for helpers and clients.

## Release process

- Bump versions in lockstep when ABI or event shapes change.
- Update [CHANGELOG](../changelog.md).
