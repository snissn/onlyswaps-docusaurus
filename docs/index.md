# Welcome to OnlySwaps

**The secure, solver-based protocol for cross-chain token transfers.**

OnlySwaps is a decentralized cross-chain protocol designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of ERC-20 tokens across EVM-compatible blockchains. Built on the security infrastructure of the **dcipher network**, OnlySwaps leverages an intent-based architecture to provide fast, secure, and capital-efficient bridging.

## How OnlySwaps Works

OnlySwaps replaces traditional lock-and-mint mechanisms with an innovative model:

1.  **Intent:** Users broadcast their intent to swap tokens by locking funds in the `Router` contract on the source chain and offering a fee.
2.  **Fulfillment:** Specialized liquidity providers, called **Solvers**, observe this intent and compete to fulfill the request immediately on the destination chain.
3.  **Verification:** The decentralized **dcipher committee** verifies the fulfillment using threshold BLS signatures.
4.  **Settlement:** Upon verification, the `Router` contract reimburses the solver (plus the fee) on the source chain.

## Key Features

*   **Intent-Based Liquidity:** Solvers provide just-in-time liquidity, optimizing capital efficiency and speed.
*   **dcipher Security Model:** Relies on decentralized threshold cryptography (BLS BN254) for verification, minimizing custodial risk and single points of failure.
*   **Upgradeable Architecture:** Core contracts utilize the UUPS pattern with time-locked, BLS-gated upgrades, ensuring robust governance and future-proofing.
*   **Developer-First Tooling:** Comprehensive SDKs (`onlyswaps-js`) and React libraries (`onlyswaps-ui`) streamline the integration process.
