# Welcome to OnlySwaps

**The definitive cross-chain token transfer protocol.**

OnlySwaps is a high-performance, secure cross-chain token transfer protocol built on the dcipher network. It enables seamless swapping of ERC-20 tokens across supported EVM blockchains.

By leveraging an intent-based architecture, OnlySwaps allows users to signal their desire to move funds and specify the fee they are willing to pay. Specialized actors called Solvers monitor these requests and compete to fulfill the transfer on the destination chain, optimizing for speed and cost-efficiency. The entire process is secured and verified by the decentralized dcipher committee using advanced threshold cryptography (BLS).

This documentation portal is designed for dApp developers, protocol integrators, security auditors, and sophisticated DeFi users.
